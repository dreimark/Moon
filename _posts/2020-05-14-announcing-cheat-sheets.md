At some day i noticed having quite a lot text files containing all kind of documentation, code snippets and mini tech i want to share.

## structured collection of code

IÂ´m planning to upload a lot of my gathered cheat sheets, scripts and snippets, this will include:

-   vim tips and most used commands
-   docker scripts and aliases for the lazy
-   bash scripts and snippets
-   lots of code for other software

## scripts for repetitive tasks

Typing the same thing over and over again is such a huge waste of time. Scripts helped me a lot to improve my onscreen time and focus on important things rather than retyping same phrases over and over.

## often used commands

Collection of often used commands for huge variety of cli tools or other kind of software.

## still work to do

I need to clean up the useless data and all the mess in my notes before being able to publish in good quality though.
